# NLP-NATGEO-GROUP-TASK

## Description

This repository contains the implementation of an NLP-based similarity calculation task. The task involves text processing and similarity analysis using TF-IDF vectorization and GloVe embeddings on a collection of National Geographic articles. The repository also includes scripts and functions designed to facilitate the experimentation process.

## Requirements

The project uses the following Python libraries:
- `scikit-learn`: For TF-IDF vectorization.
- `gensim`: For loading and working with GloVe embeddings.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `os`: For handling file paths and operations.

To install these dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn gensim numpy
```
How to Use
1.	Preprocessing Articles:
	•	Place all the articles in a folder named Articles in the root directory.
2.	Run Similarity Analysis:
	•	Use NLP_TASK.ipynb to execute the similarity analysis.
	•	Adjust file paths and configurations if necessary.
3.	Custom Functions:
	•	Import Functions_nlp.py for additional utilities and similarity calculation methods.
4.	View Results:
	•	Similarity scores for TF-IDF and GloVe embeddings are outputted in the notebook for comparison.
